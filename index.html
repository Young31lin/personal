									Hi, I'm Young (He/Him), an undergraduate student pursuing a B.S. in Compouter Science and Financial
									Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis. Since I can remember, I have always had an affinity for
									solving complex-problems involving numbers. This drew me to exploring the field of computer programming, mathematics,
									and finance. With my passion in these areas, I am interested in pursuing a career in quantitative trading and software
									development.

									Apart from my career and academic interests, I love video editing, photography, reading, traveling,
									basketball, and the gym. Feel free to send me a message if you want to chat!

								<b>Teaching Assistant (September 2021 - Present)</b><br>I am currently serving as the teaching assistant for the data structure and algorithm 
								(CSE247) class at Washington University. My responsibilities include managing a lab with 50+ students, hosting weekly 
								office hours, proctoring exams, and grading weekly assessments. During lab sessions, I would assist students by 
								clarifying lab instructions and explaining lecture concepts. Additionally, I would offer students advice on how to 
								debug their codes during office hours. This class covers challenging concepts like ordered collections, greedy/sorting
								algorithms, and run-time complexity analysis.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Academic Tutor (September 2021 - December 2021)</b><br> I served as the tutor for Engineering Student Services at my school to help students that 
								have no prior experience in coding. This includes introducing fundamental programming concepts like recursion, 
								linear data structures, and object-oriented programming. Moreover, I also offered clear alternatives to assist students 
								in debugging convoluted code. During exam weeks, I would assist students in reviewing by explaining core concepts and 
								clarifying challenging questions in the mock exam.

								<b>File System Simulation (C++)</b><br>This project is a software simulation of a file system by implementing user interface 
								similar to a command prompt. Through the implemnetation of eight unique commands, users are able to interact with 
								the file system by accessing and modifying the files it contains. This program can be accessed through command
								prompt (Windows) or terminal (iOS).
								<br>Throughout the process, I utilized object-oriented design principles and patterns to eliminate redundant code 
								and increase code flexibility. This was made possible by using interface inheritance, abstract factory 
								design pattern, prototype pattern, composite pattern, command pattern, and more to create this file simulation.
